Sound Map
=========

This program will allow users to create a field recording. The recording will be stored both as a .wav file, and an abstraction. Abstractions will be mapped into a physical space by Wolfgang's code and users will be able to relocate them, thus remixing the field recordings of an environment in the environment itself. Left alone, the abstractions will be compared to one another to determine which abstractions are most similar to one another. Similar abstractions will "move" through the space toward one another to form clusters of similar recordings which users can stumble upon and disassemble freely.

Components:
-----------
- recorder.ck: record sound files
- ana.ck: analyze a recording
- store.ck: store the results of an analysis
- compare.ck: compare analysis results
- map.ck: store comparisons and "positions" of recordings.
